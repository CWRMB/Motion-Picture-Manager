# Motion-Picture-Manager
Full Stack application in the .net, sql, Vue.js framework.

All files are contained inside the repo. However, you must setup the server/ database on your local machine. I have included the SQL script to setup the data base
easily. Also, you must change the Data Source path located in appsettings.json to the location of your server ![datasource](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89660661/200199563-e71fd1bf-d535-472b-9ca7-49fd35f46793.png)

Also, you may need to change vars.js under the ui folder to the location of your local host api server.

Here are some images from my final solution. I have included filter by name and ID number. Also, I have included ascending and descending ordering by simply
clicking on the headers of the table.
